# Unified Index to Quantifying Heterogeneity of Complex Networks

This repository contains the implementation of key formulas and figures from the paper **"Unified Index to Quantifying Heterogeneity of Complex Networks"**. Alongside the code, the original paper is also provided for reference.

## Repository Contents

- **Unified index to quantifying heterogeneity of complex networks.pdf**: The original paper.
- **Unified index to quantifying heterogeneity of complex networks.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook implementing the key formulas and generating the essential figures from the paper.

## Dependencies

To run the code, the following Python libraries are required:

- `numpy` (for numerical computations)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting figures)
- `networkx` (for working with complex networks)
- `math` (for mathematical operations)
- `os` (for file handling)
- `scipy` (specifically `scipy.special.factorial` for factorial computations)

### Installation

To install the required libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib networkx scipy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hghaemi/Unified-index-to-quantifying-heterogeneity-of-complex-networks-Paper.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd Unified-index-to-quantifying-heterogeneity-of-complex-networks-Paper
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Unified index to quantifying heterogeneity of complex networks.ipynb"
   ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the implementation and generate the figures.
